### 7a

Create a binary variable that takes on a 1 for cars with gas mileage above the median, and a 0 for cars with gas mileage below the median.

### 7b

Fit a support vector classifier to the data with various values of cost, in order to predict whether a car gets high or low gas mileage. Report the cross-validation errors associated with dif- ferent values of this parameter. Comment on your results.

### 7c

Now repeat (b), this time using SVMs with radial and polyno- mial basis kernels, with different values of gamma and degree and cost. Comment on your results.

### 7d

Make some plots to back up your assertions in (b) and (c).
