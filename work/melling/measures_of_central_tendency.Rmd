## Mean

Here's a list of 7 number [6,2,3,3,4,5,1]

To calculate the mean (average), we add the numbers then divide by 7, the number of values in our list.
$\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i$

```{r}
average = (6 + 2 + 3 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 1)/7
average = 24/7
average = 3.4285
```


## Median

[6,2,3,3,4,5,1]
Sort the list [1,2,3,3,4,5,6]

The fourth number, the second 3 is the halfway point, so that's the median.

## The Mode

The mode is the number in the list that occurs the most often
In our list, every number occurs only once, except for 3, which occurs twice.  That makes 3 the mode.

```{r}
x <- c(1,2,3,3,4,5,6)
mean(x)
mode
median(x)
table(x)
```
The Math

$\mu = \frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i$
